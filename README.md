# Bulk Create Subtags

This Anki add-on allows you to efficiently create multiple subtags at the same time for a selected tag. Instead of adding subtags one by one, you can simply type or paste a list of subtag lines, and the add-on automatically creates a hierarchical structure by enumerating each line based on its indentation.

## Features

- **Bulk Subtag Creation:** Quickly create multiple subtags for a tag with one action. Just input your subtags using indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab per level) to denote hierarchy.
- **Hierarchical Tag Structure:** Each subtag is automatically enumerated (e.g., `01_Main_Tag`, `01_Main_Tag::01_Subtag`), making it easier to organize and manage nested tags.
- **Unique Interface:** A modern, dark-themed UI styled with the Orbitron font for a distinctive look.
- **Tag Selection:** Easily select an existing parent tag using a searchable tree widget and auto-completion.
- **Persistent Settings:** User preferences such as tag tree expansions and explanation visibility are saved between sessions.
